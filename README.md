CS5610 Summer 2 2017

I'm an undergrad CS student at NEU. My past WebDev experience includes restructuring corporate websites to fit the Bootstrap framework and messing around with simple HTML/CSS back in the MySpace and Neopets days. 

This repository will house assignments from my Summer 2 2017 CS5610 Web Dev class.
